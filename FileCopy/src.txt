 The open() system call opens the file specified by pathname.  If
       the specified file does not exist, it may optionally (if O_CREAT
       is specified in flags) be created by open().

       The return value of open() is a file descriptor, a small,
       nonnegative integer that is an index to an entry in the process's
       table of open file descriptors.  The file descriptor is used in
       subsequent system calls (read(2), write(2), lseek(2), fcntl(2),
       etc.) to refer to the open file.  The file descriptor returned by
       a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not
       currently open for the process.
